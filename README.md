# Javascript Practice :smiley:

Read the instructions at the top of every file in the questions folder
and code away! There are tests found in the folder `__tests__` that you
can run with `npm test`. You should pass all the tests if you answered
them correctly.

You'll only need to touch the files in `questions`. Do not modify any
other file but feel free to look around!
